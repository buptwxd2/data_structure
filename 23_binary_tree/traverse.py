# three kinds of traverse:
# 前序遍历
# pre_order(r) = print r -> pre_order(r->left) -> pre_order(r-right)
# 中序遍历
# in_order(r) = in_order(r->left)-> print r -> in_order(r-right)
# 后序遍历
# post_order(r) = post_order(r->left) -> post_order(r->right) -> print r


# two kinds of storing: link list and array
# play with link list tree and array three and their 3 traverse methods
